        'Small displacement errors in q̂ and p̂ are corrected by projecting the state back onto the nearest lattice point using homodyne measurement and displacement correction',
        'Photon loss is directly reversed by applying the creation operator â†',

    explanation='GKP error correction: (1) Measure the position modulo √π (i.e., measure the stabilizer S_q to get the fractional displacement in q̂). (2) Apply a corrective displacement to bring q̂ back to the nearest lattice point. (3) Repeat for p̂ using S_p measurement. This works because any small displacement error ε shifts the state off the lattice; if |ε| < √π/2, the nearest lattice point is unambiguous and the shift is correctable. The logical information is encoded in which lattice coset the state lies in — this is not disturbed by measurements of the modular position.',
